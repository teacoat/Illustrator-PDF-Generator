Load the data
First the hard part, reading the data from the excel file. Unfortunately, Adobe Illustrator does not support CSV files for a data source. They do, read XML though. Fortunately, Prepression has been kind enough to write a Illustrator script that does this for you. The script is called VariableImporter. With this tool at hand let us begin:

Save your excel table as a CSV or TSV file.
Read the data in with VariableImporter.
The script is a bit temperamental but test a few things first.

Make the image dynamic
Open the variables window from Window â†’ Variables.
Select your text object that you want to change.
In variables window click the make text dynamic button with suitable data column selected.

Make text dynamic

You can now test the different record in action. Data in set

Repeats 1-3 steps until you have all you want to change.

Export each variable as a PDF.
To export the data sets into multiple pdf files do this:

Make a new action where you save a pdf document.
From the menu in Actions window corner, select Batch...

Set the source to Data Sets, Override save commands, and a folder.
